# Car-Rental-System

We have developed this project to book a car online at a discounted rate. At present all booking work is done manually and it makes a lot of difficulties to maintain the information of booking and available cars. A Car rental system is a car booking program that offers a complete solution for all of your day-to-day needs. This method enables you to retain customer information online. This technology allows you to check your customer information at any moment.

This Car rental system program has certain features such as a Login system using a password so that only registered customers can access the program and do the booking. Another feature is that the user can choose a driver if they want. The main key part is this program generates a digital customer invoice bill. So, for this, we have used a database management system, so this is permanently saved in an external folder. This program is built using the concepts of the C++ programming language.  The concept of classes and objects, If- else statements, File handling, etc. are used. In order to run the project, we have to install Code::Blocks, Dev C++ or, GCC compiler. The hardware requirements are very minimized for the running of the program. 

The future scope of this program is that we can add more facilities for users. We can create a backup mechanism for backing up data and information.  Online firms with a good understanding of the Indian psyche and a willingness to cater to their requirements would have a bright future.

Car Rental System is a program used to book cars through online mode. The concept behind the Car Rental System is to rent cars and generate rental invoices for a rental company. This project contains few features, but they are all necessary and the advantage is that we can further add more features and functions. The project uses the concepts of classes and file handling, which are the features of C++. So that the user’s data is stored on a separate database. This program gives some special features such as a login system for the purpose of security so that only registered users can access the program. Another feature is that it will provide a customer invoice bill with all the details. This will be stored permanently.
